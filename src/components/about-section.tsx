          RMBG is a boutique advisory and development firm based in Amsterdam,
          The Netherlands. For over a decade, we've been helping companies turn

        <p className="mb-4">
          We specialize in identifying disruption potential—whether through new
          technologies, business models, or user experiences—and rapidly
          translating it into prototypes, hardware, AI models, and commercial
          products.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">We don't just advise. We build.</p>

          Our clients range from global corporations and mission-driven NGOs to
          ambitious startups. Our work spans industries such as consumer
          electronics, industrial hardware, AI, cybersecurity, and
          sustainability.
